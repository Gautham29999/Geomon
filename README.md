# Geomon

Geomon is a small game I made that was inspired by the Pokemon trading card game.

# How to get started playing this game

 - After cloning this repository, make sure all the files are in the same directory.
- There is a user file named OPTEST with the password op which you could use to speed run through the game.
- The geomon are also not balanced so you may find a few geomons that are really strong.
- Hope you enjoy this game and I would love some feedback/recommendations.

# Nex Steps
This is just a concept and I do plan on improving the story. I also plan on making the geomons more balanced and adding more geomon types to make the game more interesting.
Additionally I would like to add some GUI's to make thegame more aesthetically pleasing rather than playing from the terminal
